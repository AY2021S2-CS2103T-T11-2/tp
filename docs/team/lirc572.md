## Project: AddressBook Level 3

CoLAB (Collaboration Lab) is a desktop app for university students to manage their school projects. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to manage groupmates (`addG`, `updateG`, `deleteG` commands) (Pull requests [\#82](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/82), [\#108](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/108), [\#206](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/206), [\#214](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/214))
  * What it does: Adds a list of groupmates to each project, allows the user to create, read, update and delete groupmates with commands.
  * Justification: This feature is the main "colab" feature of CoLAB. It allows the user to manage group projects more easily.
  * Highlights: It is nothing more than some copy-paste and rename from AB3.
  * Credits: original [AB3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S2/tp) authors.

  * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (6 releases) on GitHub.
  * Managed deadlines and deliverables for the group, including updating the issue tracker and milestones.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Wrote additional tests for models to increase coverage from 67.19% to 72.17% (Pull requests [\#133](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/133)

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the groupmate features [\#247](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/247)
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of contact features `clear`, `exit`: [\#247](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/pull/247)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the update commands.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
